    This is a CloudFoundry [firehose
    nozzle](https://docs.pivotal.io/tiledev/2-8/nozzle.html) by connecting to
    the Cloud Foundry Reverse Log Proxy (RLP) Gateway that feeds metrics from
    the Loggregator. This uses the new RLP Gateway model that was [introduced
    in Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF)
    2.4](https://docs.pivotal.io/tiledev/2-4/release-notes.html#log-api), so it
    will not work with older releases.

    It supports `gauge` and `counter` metrics at this time.  All of the `tags` in
    the firehose envelopes will be converted to dimensions when sending to
    SignalFx.
